# SpaghettiSupplyProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

This is a simple project made for fun where I can throw anything I am curious about while testing some basic things about Angular. Most of it is just junk or fun, or advertising for friends YouTube channels. The site is hosted at https://spaghetti.supply and is run off the ng-deploy gh-pages utility which helps hosting from github.
